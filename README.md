## Overview

KineticCore is an intelligent system analysis tool that evaluates hardware components using advanced metrics and provides meaningful insights about your system's capabilities. It uses quantum-inspired normalization and temporal adjustments to deliver accurate, future-proof performance ratings.

## Features

- üéØ **Instant Performance Rating**: Get a comprehensive score out of 140 points
- üîÆ **Future-Aware Analysis**: Automatically adjusts scores based on technological progression
- üå°Ô∏è **Thermal Efficiency**: Considers power consumption and thermal characteristics
- üìä **Component-Level Analysis**: Detailed insights for CPU and GPU performance
- üìà **Multiple Export Formats**: Save reports in JSON, CSV, or TXT formats
- üé® **Color-Coded Output**: Intuitive visual feedback using terminal colors

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/KuekHaoYang/KinetiCore.git
cd kineticcore
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the program:
```bash
python main.py
```

Follow the prompts to input your system's benchmark scores:
- Single-Core CPU Score
- Multi-Core CPU Score
- OpenCL GPU Score
- TDP (Thermal Design Power) in Watts

## Performance Tiers

The system classifies hardware into the following performance strata:

| Score Range | Tier | Description |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 140+ | Titan Class | Beyond cutting-edge systems |
| 120-139 | Quantum Elite | Flagship workstations |
| 100-119 | Dragonfire | Extreme gaming rigs |
| 80-99 | Phoenix | Enthusiast systems |
| 60-79 | Griffin | Premium devices |
| 40-59 | Basilisk | Productivity systems |
| 20-39 | Chimera | Basic computing |
| 0-19 | Ancient | Legacy hardware |
